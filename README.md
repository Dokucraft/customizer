# Dokucraft Customizer
This repo contains scripts, configs, and other files used by the Dokucraft customizer to make changes to the packs.

There are two main files in the customizer: `main.js` and `customizer.json`.
- `customizer.json` defines the options that are presented to the user on the website. The configuration passed to the customizer scripts is based on these options and what the user chooses for each option. [Read more about customizer.json here.](https://github.com/Dokucraft/customizer/blob/main/CUSTOMIZER.md)
- `main.js` is the script that will modify the resource pack based on what the user chose. [Read more about customizer scripts here.](https://github.com/Dokucraft/customizer/blob/main/SCRIPTS.md)
